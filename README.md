`cd Obscure-Player`

`npm install`

`npm run dev`


## Made with a good friend's boilerplate...
Used Electron-Vue. Features a sweet webpacked bundle including vuejs, vuex, router, and most importantly, Electron. Below my content you will find the attached readme for the Electron-Vue Boilerplate.

## Overview
The direction of this was to mess around with electron-vue and learn. This will be my first electron project. I started programming brand-spanking-new back in mid February. I am a four-month greenhorn and needed something to do. So far, this has taken me about 3-4 days. Still much to fix, style, etc. You will find more info in the TODO section.

**Don't forget to check out and star Electron-Vue [here](https://github.com/SimulatedGREG/electron-vue).**

## Overview
The aim of this project is to remove the need to setup electron apps using vue. Since vue can take advantage of module loaders like webpack, getting everything to play nicely can be a little tricky.

**Check out the documentation [here](https://simulatedgreg.gitbooks.io/electron-vue/content/index.html).**

Things you'll find in this boilerplate...
  * Basic project structure
  * Ready to use Vue plugins ([vue-electron](https://github.com/SimulatedGREG/vue-electron),  [vue-resource](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-resource), [vue-router](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-router), [vuex](https://github.com/vuejs/vuex))
  * A working set of the [vue-devtools](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-devtools) for development
  * Ability to easily create builds of your electron app using [electron-userland/electron-packager](https://github.com/electron-userland/electron-packager)
  * Handy NPM scripts
  * Use of webpack and [vue-loader](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-loader) for Hot Module Replacement
  * CSS pre-processor support
  * ES6 by default
  * ESLint (extends 'standard')
